# Hormonal-regulation-of-growth-in-juvenile-fish
We combine physiological, environmental and evolutionary aspects of fish growth in a state-dependent model where the optimal regulation of growth and survival is achieved through hormonal regulation of behaviour.

The code is developed by Jaqueline Weidner and Camilla Håkonsrud Jensen, in cooperation with Christian Jørgensen, all at Department of Biological Sciences at University of Bergen.
